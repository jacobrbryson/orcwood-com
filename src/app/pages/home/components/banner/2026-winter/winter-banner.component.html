          Welcome to Winter Introspection&mdash;a gentle, community-driven art challenge designed for reflection, creativity, and play.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Your challenge:</strong><br />
          🖼️ Create at least three self-portraits, each in a different medium, between December 21st and March 21st.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before you look at the lines, shapes, and tone of your face, look inward and decide the boundaries of what is challenging for you. The goal here is that it is not too easy but also not overwhelming so that you feel pushed to grow but also find success. So everyone’s challenge will look a little different as we all work within these loose guidelines.
        </p>

        <h3>Guidelines:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Each submission should be a unique medium: You choose what counts as a different medium. For instance, pencil &amp; charcoal &amp; Bic pen &mdash; all drawing media &mdash; still count as unique. In addition to traditional art media, might consider ways of conveying a self-portrait that is novel.</li>
          <li>Photography (a selfie) is fine for a submission, but I don't recommend submitting your reference photo used in another submission, as it invites unnecessary comparison and judgement. On the flipside, you are not required to post a selfie.</li>
          <li>No AI. All work submitted must be made by you depicting you.</li>
          <li>This is not a judged competition. Submissions are shared only for community, encouragement, and accountability.</li>
          <li>No policing. You get to interpret these rules/guidelines only for yourself. Everyone defines their own level of challenge.</li>
          <li>The only deadline is March 21st (Equinox). Other deadlines (the 21st of each month?) are up to you and what challenges you and is within your bandwidth. You do you! Also, you paint/draw/sculpt you. 😉</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The goal is simple: to make art, explore ourselves, and notice how the light slowly returns as winter unfolds. Share progress, ideas, struggles, and wins freely&mdash;this is a space for connection and introspection.
